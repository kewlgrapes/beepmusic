PURPOSE
  beepmusic! is a tool that can be used to easily(?) play music using a
  computer's PC speaker.  beepmusic! is inspired by solfège, a music
  education method used to teach pitch and sight seeing. Solfège involves
  assigning the notes of a scale a particular syllable (rather than note
  names like C5 or F#7). beepmusic! files are notated using intervals
  from a base pitch, making it trivial to transpose music to different keys.

  python beepserver.py
    Brings up the beepmusic! server.
    Server listens at 127.0.0.1:8000 (configurable).

FILES

    This file provides core functionality. 

  song*.bm
    These are some sample songs notated in the beepmusic! format.

  beepserver.py
    This file brings up the web-based frontend to beepmusic!.

  resources/*
    These are HTML/CSS/JS files used to display the web-based frontend.

COMMAND FORMATS
  Individual commands should be separated by whitespace (spaces, tabs, or
  new line characters). beepmusic! will ignore any line starting with #.
  Commands are case sensitive. See examples in song0.bm, song1.bm, 
  and song2.bm.

  b<frequency>
    Sets the base pitch to <frequency>, given in hertz (Hz).

  t<tempo>
    Sets the tempo to <tempo> beats per minute (bpm).

  w[.]<offset>
    Emits a whole note (4 counts) at the pitch <offset> semitones from 
    the base pitch. w can optionally be followed by a . to multiply the
    note duration by 1.5x. <offset> can be positive, negative, or 0.

  h[.]<offset>
    Emits a half note (2 counts) at the pitch <offset> semitones from 
    the base pitch.
    
  q[.]<offset>
    Emits a quarter note (1 count) at the pitch <offset> semitones from 
    the base pitch.
    
  e[.]<offset>
    Emits an eighth note (1/2 count) at the pitch <offset> semitones from 
    the base pitch.
    
  s[.]<offset>
    Emits a sixteenth note (1/4 count) at the pitch <offset> semitones from 
    the base pitch.
